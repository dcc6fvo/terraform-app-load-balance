# terraform-app-load-balance

In this terraform/aws script we build a setup with an application load balancer. We will end up with following resources:

  - one app load balancer that redirect traffic to two private subnets
  - two management instances each in a different public subnet that can be used with Ansible and/or another config. tool
  - two webserver instances each in a different private subnet that will respond to the load balancer requests
  
*NAT Gateways, Routers, Databases were abstract from the design but necessary
